## Filtering

```shell
curl -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
https://api.tradegecko.com/products?created_at_min=2015-11-04/
```

```ruby
require 'gecko-ruby'
gecko = Gecko::Client.new(<OAUTH_ID>, <OAUTH_SECRET>)
access_token = OAuth2::AccessToken.new(gecko.oauth_client, <ACCESS_TOKEN>)
gecko.access_token = access_token

gecko.Product.where(created_at_min: "2015-11-04")
```

The API also allows filtering of records by passing query parameters
These are the filters currently allowed by the API (where relevant)

###  Index Filters

| Arguments          | Description
|--------------------|--------------------
| **ids**            | An array of object IDs
| **created_at_min** | Return objects only created since
| **created_at_max** | Return objects only created before
| **updated_at_min** | Return objects only updated since
| **updated_at_max** | Return objects only updated before
| **order**          | The order to return the collection i.e "created_at desc"
| **limit**          | See the pagination docs (default is 100)
| **page**           | See the pagination docs

Each object has their own specific filters; we cover those filters in their respective sections.

### HTTP Request
`GET  https://api.tradegecko.com/products?ids=1,2,3&order=created_at+desc&limit=3`

### Batching Requests
As shown in the example above, requests can be batched together to get products with different IDs in a single API call. Similarly, batching can be done on a number of objects by applying filters. Batching this way using filters can cut down on the number of API calls needed. For example, a single API call can return products with different brands:

`GET https://api.tradegecko.com/products?brand[]=ABC&brand[]=XYZ`

The above API call will return an array of products with brand ABC or brand XYC.

Such batching using filters can be done for other objects.

### Using Different Filters Together
You can use different filters in a single API call. For example:

`GET https://api.tradegecko.com/companies?company_status=active&company_type=supplier&order=created_at+desc&limit=20`
