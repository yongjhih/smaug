# TradeGecko API

Build tools that solve problems for millions of wholesale and retail businesses worldwide.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right; switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

If anything is missing or seems incorrect, please check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tradegecko/smaug/issues)
for existing known issues or [create a new issue](https://github.com/tradegecko/smaug/issues/new).

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'gecko-ruby'
gecko = Gecko::Client.new(<OAUTH_ID>, <OAUTH_SECRET>)
access_token = OAuth2::AccessToken.new(gecko.oauth_client, <ACCESS_TOKEN>)
gecko.access_token = access_token
gecko.Account.current
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

> Make sure to replace `<ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your API key.

TradeGecko uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new TradeGecko API key at our [developer portal](http://developer.tradegecko.com/).

TradeGecko expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;</code> with your personal API key.
